# GPS User Interface

## To Do:

### Higher Priority
* File Open to select another JSON.
* Allow only one of each window to open.
* Have "local" option to run commands on local machine without sendcmdserver active.
* Error Handling for sendcmdclient
* Updating client info should change all trees with same name in configuration.
* delete config
* dialogue box asking if you want to modify clients in tab when changing command or tab tree.
* ERROR - change directory back to exe directory after sending cd command.

### Lower Priority:
- Implement WOL option.

- Simplify ClientTabFrame class as it sloppy.
	- ScrollFrame should only worry about packing ClientTabFrame.
	- ClientTabFrame will handle packing TabBarTree and TabTreeMouseOver into itself.

### Optional:
- Lightmode/Darkmode.
- Output window
