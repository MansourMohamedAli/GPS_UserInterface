# GPS User Interface

## To Do:

### Higher Priority
* Create save button/option
* Write to JSON file.
* changed order of commands using buttons on TabTreeMouseOver buttons
* Rename Tabs
* File Open to select another JSON.
* Allow only one of each window to open.
* Configuration class should instantiate with only configuration passed in. not with clients,commands,tab_clients,tab_commands.

### Lower Priority:
- Implement WOL option.

- Simplify ClientTabFrame class as it sloppy.
	- ScrollFrame should only worry about packing ClientTabFrame.
	- ClientTabFrame will handle packing TabBarTree and TabTreeMouseOver into itself.

### Optional:
- Lightmode/Darkmode.
- Output window
